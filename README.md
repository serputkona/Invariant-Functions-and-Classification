# Invariant Functions and Classification

This repository focuses on calculating invariant functions and classifying images based on their values. It includes the following components:

## Calculating Invariant Functions

- **Reference Images**: Calculates invariant functions for the reference images `a.bmp`, `b.bmp`, `f.bmp`, and `m.bmp`.
- **Central Moments and Normalized Moments**: Computes central moments, centers of mass, and normalized central moments using the provided discrete formulas.

## Classification

- **Classifying Images**: For images `a1.bmp`, `a2.bmp`, `b1.bmp`, `f1.bmp`, and `m1.bmp`, classifies images according to their values of invariant functions (1) and (2).

## Calculation Details

- **Formulas**: Use the provided formulas for calculating invariant functions, central moments, and normalized central moments. Note that the images are discrete, and the formulas are adapted accordingly.
