# Invariant-Functions-and-Classification
Calculation of invariant functions and classification by their values
1. Calculate the invariant functions for reference images a.bmp, b.bmp, f.bmp, m.bmp.
2. For images a1.bmp, a2.bmp, b1.bmp, f1.bmp, m1.bmp, classify images according to their values of invariant functions (1), (2).

In order to calculate the values of the invariant functions, we need to calculate the central moments, the centers of mass and then the normalized central moments. Note that the image is discrete, so the formulas for calculations will look like this:
